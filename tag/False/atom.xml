&lt;p&gt;So in other words, is it a lie for someone to unwittingly pass on false information, or are they not lying because they genuinely believe it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My view on it is that if I were told that Mercury was the hottest planet (a falsehood) and believed it, then told someone, I wouldn’t be lying, even though I’d been misinformed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that the consensus, or would people instead say that lying is based on whether or not something is actually “true” and that I had actually unwittingly lied?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t really make sense to me that unwittingly lying is a thing, because one does believe it and isn’t trying to deceive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.dandart.co.uk/post/2021/10/is-telling-falsehood-always-lie"/></entry><entry><id>youre-doing-it-wrong-how-to-report-bug</id><title type="text">You're Doing It Wrong: How to report a bug</title><updated>2016-10-19 19:45:00 UTC</updated><author><name>Dan Dart</name></author><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[Taken from a Google+ post]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many support requests don't contain critical information needed to actually support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to ask for help by following these instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure all attachments and power are double checked to be secure connections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for an error message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google the error message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit your question along with any error related output, custom settings and most importantly steps to reproduce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't pester.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn English, it's a lot better if you use proper grammar so that people will understand your problem.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrong&lt;/strong&gt;: Help!!! My Linux doesn't want print! I need have my no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right&lt;/strong&gt;: My brand x model y printer refuses to print on the grounds that I get the coloured light z and my distribution Q tells me that the reason is W when I try to G and then H. Can somebody suggest what steps I should take to resolve this?&lt;/p&gt;
