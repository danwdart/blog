I've got a new tech blog out - it's intended for things attributable to JolHarg (e.g. release announcements, tutorials, news, assorted tech things), in order to separate my non-code/non-"official" thoughts and opinions from those of my company, for what it's worth. This isn't due to anything I plan to say, but rather so that people who would like code-only thoughts can get them. I've moved some of my older blogs from this blog to that blog, if they were better attributed, too. Please let me know if you think I've miscategorised anything. Please also remember to reset your RSS feed reader, if you use the atom feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href="https://blog.jolharg.com"&gt;JolHarg Blog&lt;/a&gt;, and here's the new &lt;a href="https://blog.jolharg.com/atom.xml"&gt;atom feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the comments are back!&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.dandart.co.uk/post/2022/09/new-tech-blog"/></entry></feed>
