&lt;p&gt;So in other words, is it a lie for someone to unwittingly pass on false information, or are they not lying because they genuinely believe it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My view on it is that if I were told that Mercury was the hottest planet (a falsehood) and believed it, then told someone, I wouldn’t be lying, even though I’d been misinformed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that the consensus, or would people instead say that lying is based on whether or not something is actually “true” and that I had actually unwittingly lied?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t really make sense to me that unwittingly lying is a thing, because one does believe it and isn’t trying to deceive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.dandart.co.uk/post/2021/10/is-telling-falsehood-always-lie"/></entry></feed>
