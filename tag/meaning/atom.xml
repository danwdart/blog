I'm now finding that some of that information is viewed not quite as I had written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lies"&gt;Lies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've recently been researching the meaning of lying, and there seems to be quite the divide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, some believe that lying is a deliberate act, and some believe that it directly translates to "untruth", whether deliberate or accidental. What is your understanding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I be lying if I told you something I legitimately believed, which turned out not to be true? Are people actually invested in pseudoscience lying, or is it just the people who told them that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I get this blog ready with comments again, I shall also add the ability to poll, so you can easily tell me your side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.dandart.co.uk/post/2021/11/on-lying-again"/></entry></feed>
