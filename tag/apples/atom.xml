&lt;p&gt;Algebra's the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'd know that if I told you that my friend Geoff (I don't have a friend called Geoff) came home with three more apples and five more oranges, that we would have a fruit party, because we're pathetically hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using algebra is just the same as having shorthand. Maybe it's not the concept, but it's the shorthand that bothers some people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know that if algebra is difficult for one person then arithmetic is also difficult, but do let me know if it is this way for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All algebra's doing is giving things shorter names so that they can be manipulated more quickly. Perhaps that's where the issues start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this therefore confuses you, it may be something deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to have the letter "r" short for oranges here, as having "o" is too much like zero:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2a + 3r + 3a + 5r = ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it easier if I write it in words?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two apples, and three oranges, and three more apples and five more oranges, is how many of both?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real life you'd know to count apples together and oranges together, and even if you do it one by one, I'm struggling to see where the difficulty is in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the difficulty having symbolic metaphors? (I have to use 🔶 for oranges because Blogger doesn't know about them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2🍏 + 3🔶 + 3🍏 + 5🔶 = ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would one have to count them out to make more sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🍏🍏🔶🔶🔶🍏🍏🍏🔶🔶🔶🔶🔶 = ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's now just simple rearrangement. Is that somehow easier? So, I move some around and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🍏🍏🔶🔶🔶🍏🍏🍏🔶🔶🔶🔶🔶 = 🍏🍏🍏🍏🍏🔶🔶🔶🔶🔶🔶🔶🔶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ta-da!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I wonder how much all of that costs...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I really struggle to understand which bit of algebra is difficult for people. Any thoughts, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.dandart.co.uk/post/2018/07/algebra-is-not-hard"/></entry></feed>
